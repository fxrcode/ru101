# RU101

## Setup environment
* clone the course repo: https://github.com/redislabs-training/ru101, then follow the process.
* only difference is that I've already installed requirement.txt in conda env: `mypy3`, therefore no need to use venv.
* install latest (Feb 2, 2021) stable redis (6.0.10) in ~/Tools folder.
